[Folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_folding) has been rolled out and is now implemented since Visual Studio Code [version 0.10.11](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/vFebruary). There are these keyboard shortcuts available:

* **Fold** folds the innermost uncollapsed region at the cursor:
  * Ctrl + Shift + \[ on Windows and Linux
  * ⌥ + ⌘ + \[ on macOS
* **Unfold** unfolds the collapsed region at the cursor:
  * Ctrl + Shift + \] on Windows and Linux
  * ⌥ + ⌘ + \] on macOS
* **Fold All** folds all regions in the editor:
  * Ctrl + \(K =&gt; 0\) \(zero\) on Windows and Linux
  * ⌘ + \(K =&gt; 0\) \(zero\) on macOS
* **Unfold All** unfolds all regions in the editor:
  * Ctrl + \(K =&gt; J\) on Windows and Linux
  * ⌘ + \(K =&gt; J\) on macOS
